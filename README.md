## 🧐 What is This?

**Retarded Auditor** checks for common red flags in Solana tokens, such as:
- Mint Authority Status
- Liquidity Pool Information
- Social Media Presence
- Token Holder Distribution (Top Holders)

It then compiles this information into a simple, shareable "Retarded Report Card" with a final verdict that's easy to understand.
